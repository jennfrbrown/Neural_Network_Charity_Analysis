# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: 

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?<br>
The variable considered for the target in the model is the "Is_Successful".

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?<br>
The variables that are considered to be features for my model are: 
  - Application_Type
  - Affiliation
  - Classification
  - Use_Case
  - Status
  - Income_Amt
  - Special Considerations
  - Ask_Amt

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?<br>
Variables that are neither targets nor features and were removed from the input data are EIN and Name.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
